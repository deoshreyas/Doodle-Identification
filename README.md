# Doodle-Identification

## :zap: About
I wanted to experiment with Google's Teachable Machine so I built this little application to identify doodles!

## :desktop_computer: How to run locally
Just clone the repository on your machine, and install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You can use a virtual environment for this. Then just run `main.py` and have fun!
